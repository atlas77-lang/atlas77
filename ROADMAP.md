# Atlas77 Roadmap

I tried to maintain this document and keep track of a good roadmap, but sadly because of all the refactoring going on, I will just keep it blank for now.

## Current Focus

* C backend with TinyCC fallback. (working-ish)
* Redoing the move semantics to be more inlined with C++ model.
* Redoing the standard library leveraging 50+ years of C standard library. (yes I am gonna steal from it)
* Removing the VM and everything related to it. (mostly done)
